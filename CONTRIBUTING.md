Pull Requests are great (on the **dev** branch)!

 1. Fork the Repo on github.
 2. Add yourself to AUTHORS.txt
 3. Add a test if possible.
 4. Push to your fork and submit a **pull request to the dev branch**.

My **master** branch is a 100% stable (should be). I only push to it after I am
certain that things are working out. Many people are using Jedi directly from
the github master branch. 

Please use Pep8 to style your code.
